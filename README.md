# Datathon Project

## Our Question:
### Where should TXST recruit?' We'll use TEA to map the competitive landscape and compare Texas schools, then create a df combining county SAT/ACT scores and THECB college enrollment data to identify high performing regions currently underserved by universities or where theres a low number of txst enrollies where TXST could capture more students.
