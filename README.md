# Datathon Project

## Our Question:
### Where should TXST recruit?' We'll use TEA to map the competitive landscape and compare Texas schools, then create a df combining county SAT/ACT scores and THECB college enrollment data to identify high performing regions currently underserved by universities or where theres a low number of txst enrollies where TXST could capture more students.

## 🗺️ Analysis Approach

### Phase 1: Map Student Talent Distribution
- Identify counties with high SAT/ACT performance
- Analyze college-readiness rates by region
- Visualize geographic distribution of high-performing students

### Phase 2: Competitive Landscape Analysis
- Calculate distance from each county to major universities
- Map institutional coverage and "education deserts"
- Compare TXST's accessibility to competitors

### Phase 3: Enrollment Pattern Analysis
- Determine where high-performing students currently enroll
- Calculate TXST's market share by region
- Identify regions where competitors dominate

### Phase 4: Opportunity Identification
**Target Profile:**
- Counties with above-average SAT/ACT scores
- Reasonable distance to San Marcos (50-150 miles)
- Currently underserved by major universities
- Lower enrollment rates at UT/A&M (less competition)
- Growing population/demographics

### Phase 5: Strategic Recommendations
- Rank counties by recruitment opportunity score
- Identify specific high schools for targeted outreach
- Propose data-driven recruitment strategies
